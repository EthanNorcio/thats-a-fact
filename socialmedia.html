		<h1 class="white">Social Media Platforms - That's A Fact!</h1>
		<h3 class="blue">Nowadays, social media platforms almost always provide the most up-to-date information. This content not only includes the news-worthy, but also the events in the daily lives of your close friends.</h3>
		<h3 class="white">Social media may be the fastest platform to spread information, but since everyone can contribute to these websites, the authenticity news we get from these platforms may be questionable.</h3>
		<p style="float:left;"><img id="img1" src="..\images\fbk.jpg" alt="Facebook Logo"><img class="img1b" src="..\images\twt.jpg" alt="Twitter Logo"><img class="img1b" src="..\images\ytb.jpg" alt="YouTube Logo"></p>
		<div id="p1">
			<h4 class="p1cb">Here are some examples of social media platforms that may provide questionable information.</h4>
			<h4>
				<ul class="white">
					<li>Famous in the Philippines: <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com">Tiktok</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></li>
					<li>Other Commonly Used Social Media Platforms: <a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></li>
				</ul>
			</h4>
			<h5 class="p1cb">Usually, social media platforms have "pages" which will show similar content that share a common topic. They also have "account pages" which can be used to view all the content created or shared by a certain account. Learning how to use them will let you know where to find the information you need quickly.</h5>
		</div>
		<p style="float:right;"><img id="img2" src="..\images\vrf.jpg" alt="Verified Badge"></p>
		<div id="p2">
			<h4 class="p2cb">Here are the usual account pages that probably contain true and reliable information.</h4>
			<h4>
				<ul class="white">
					<li>Pages controlled by News Networks</li>
					<li>Pages controlled by Expert Organizations
						<ul>
							<li>For example, the Facebook page of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PAGASA.DOST.GOV.PH">DOST-PAGASA</a> contains reliable news and information about the weather such as Typhoon Cyclone Wind Signals during a typhoon.
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Verified Accounts*</li>
				</ul>
			</h4>
			<h5 class="p2cb">We can expect news networks to be reliable sources of information since they are trusted to report day-to-day events accurately and timely. We need to be careful though, since some posers may try to replicate them.</h5>
			<h5 class="p2cw">Expert Organizations are considered reliable since they have enough knowledge to report on a certain specific field.</h5>
			<h5 class="p2cb">Verified accounts are social media users who are celebrities, government officials, or generally famous people. It's difficult to differentiate true information than personal opinions so fact-checking is very important.</h5>
